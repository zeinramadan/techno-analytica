Thanks for all the feedback and support so far ❤️",
"We are super happy to announce that from now on we will also be playing and releasing as a duo called @funkassault !

When we met each other for the first time, we quickly realised that a special connection happened. Nothing has felt smoother than the flow we experienced in the studio. Hard to describe how we share the same vision. The artistic direction is implicitly known but there is always space for continuously building on each other idea and creating stuff that we wouldn’t have come up alone, and this of course, never happens without a unique friendship 🔥 Not even once we shared the decks as we were expecting to find again such a momentum in our b2b, and it indeed happened during this all night long at @folklor_club 

Founding a duo-band hence felt like pretty obvious step of the process after that. We’re super excited to present you Funk Assault : a project with the goal to challenge the purist codes and to fight the toxic commercial expectations of the scene

A 12' EP Is already on its way and we can't wait to share with you the recording of this all night long. Big big OG things are cominnnnn",

Thanks for the already big support 😍",
"Well, to say that this was unexpected is an understatement. Being young, still having a lot to learn and achieve doesn’t make it easy to accept this award. However, everyday I devote myself on finding my own sound, mastering new techniques and contributing to the scene. 

And this is maybe what I need to focus on if I need to find an explanation. 

But more importantly, if I’m holding this “Raving Spoon” today it’s thanks to you. It would actually be fair to say that its also yours. To the people who share, support and enjoy my work. 

Because everything that I give you, you give it back thousands of times stronger. This is what drives me to push my limits and... this is probably what I live for. 

So the only thing I can say today is :

Thank you ❤️",

Big big thanks to @asquithhhhh and to you guys for the trust & support ❤️❤️

Check link in bio for the previews !!

...and it's only the beginning 😏😏

‘Forgot To Dream’ kicks the trance revival into full swing; an emotional party track brimming with euphoric ‘hands in the air’ moments - unting the worlds of hard dance and fun, no frills cheese that results in a deadly blend. ‘We Will Bring It Back’ is a little more pertinacious as we see those hands turn to fists, banging a metaphorical drum as frenzied rave samples and kicks as hard as concrete dominate.

‘Double Dose’ sounds like something Sarumans Orc army would march to if electronic music was the order of the day in the LOTR universe; bruising kicks, alien atmospherics and glitchy techno inciting a mass frenzy before ‘Long Time No See takes us on a deep voyage direct to the underworld with a cut of typically loud and bloodcurdling rave.",
